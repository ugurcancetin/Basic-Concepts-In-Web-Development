### Prerequisites

To be able to enjoy this repo, you need to have basic level of programming experience. If you have ever 
used one of the IDE that web developers use, you don't need to worry about anything!!!
A text editor is even enough. Sublime 2/3 or Notepad++ etc.

## How To use

Simply, Master branch includes all the examples with the specific commits in the history. There are several other branches to see the topics that has been added by the time.

My recommandation is follow the branches based on the order that is given below:
```
1-) Basics of HTML5 and CSS3
2-) Bootstrap
3-) jQuery
4-) NodeJs
5-) FrameWork-Express
6-) MongoDB
7-) Authencatation
8-) JavaScript-Tricky-Stuffs
9-) Master
```
Branches are adding the topics on the top of previous branch. You will be able to recognize the differences between the branches if you follow the order which is given up. The titles of the examples also gives an info about the example content. If not enough, you can check out commit message for little bit more detailly info.

### Installing

Listed items are very popular in open source world and you can find many different tutorials. Just search for it!

Codes are having inline comments which I think will be useful to understand the instances.

Hope it will be useful for the beginners.
